# DeepMasterPrint2

This repository contains the code for the paper _[Diversity and Novelty MasterPrints: Generating Multiple DeepMasterPrints for Increased User Coverage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04909.pdf)_

## Requirements
For using the code, many of the paths route to local code utils files and datasets (i.e. the wrapper Verifinger code [`sub_verifinger.py`](Verifinger_Custom_Code/sub_verifinger.py)). Please remember to change these paths to match your own local path. 


## Acknowledgements
To run this code fully you must download the Verifinger framework software. Please see the _[README](Verifinger_Custom_Code/README.md)_ in the `Verifinger_Custom_Code` folder for more information.

Kindly be informed that the dataset employed in this code repository is not included due to copyright and privacy restrictions. However, we have indicated the specific dataset used (CAPACITIVE, OPTICAL, NIST)(see our [previous work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07386.pdf) for detail), enabling you to source it from the designated provider. Please make sure to adhere to all copyright and usage regulations when obtaining and utilizing the dataset.
